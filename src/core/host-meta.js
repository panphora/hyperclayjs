/**
 * host-meta.js — what this host can do (spec §5).
 *
 * Ported from clayjs so that live sync can pick its wire from what the host
 * advertises instead of hardcoding one address. Spec §10 moved live sync to
 * `/_/sync` for both directions, but hyperclay, hyperclay-local and older
 * htmlclay releases all still serve the original `/_/live-sync/*` pair, and an
 * installed host upgrades on its owner's schedule rather than ours.
 *
 * The spec's rule about what counts as an answer is deliberately strict on the
 * way in and forgiving on the way out. Only a 2xx carrying a JSON object with a
 * numeric `spec` is a capability document. A 404, an HTML error page from a
 * proxy, a redirect, a body that will not parse: all of them mean "bare core
 * host", and a bare core host is fully conforming. Discovery failing must never
 * cost a person their save, so this never throws and never rejects.
