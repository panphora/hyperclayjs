/**
 * Unsaved Warning Module
 *
 * Warns users before leaving the page if there are unsaved changes.
 * Self-contained: compares current page content to last saved content on beforeunload.
 *
 * Works independently of autosave - no mutation observer needed during editing,
 * just a single comparison when the user tries to leave.
 *
 * Both current and stored content have [save-remove] and [save-ignore] stripped,
 * so comparison is direct with no parsing needed.
 *
 * Requires the 'save-system' module (automatically included as dependency).
