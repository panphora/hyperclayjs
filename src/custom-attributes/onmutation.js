/*
   [onmutation] - Trigger code when this element or its children change

   Usage:
   <div onmutation="console.log('My content changed')">
     <span contenteditable>Edit me</span>
   </div>

   Unlike [onglobalmutation]/[onpagemutation] which fires on ANY DOM change,
   [onmutation] only fires when the element itself or its descendants mutate.

  // changed — the still-attached parent for add/remove (the removed node is
  // detached), otherwise the changed element itself — and run any [onmutation]
  // ancestor, exactly as a per-element subtree observer would. An element's own
  // insertion is its parent's childList change, so (correctly) doesn't fire it.
  //
  // require:'observed' makes it region-aware (skips no-watch / extension noise),
  // which the old per-element observers were not. It stays PAUSABLE (the
  // default): a live-sync morph must NOT fire the hook, or the hook's own DOM
  // writes would autosave → broadcast → morph the other tab → fire the same hook
  // → broadcast back, looping forever. Skipping morphs is safe because the other
  // tab already ran this identical hook, so the morph carries the result.
