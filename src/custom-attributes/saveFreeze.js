/**
 * [save-freeze] Custom Attribute
 *
 * Freezes an element's innerHTML for save purposes.
 * The live DOM can change freely, but the saved HTML always
 * contains the original content captured when the element first appeared.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   <div save-freeze>Content that JS will modify at runtime</div>
 *
 * The original innerHTML is captured:
 *   - On page load, for all existing [save-freeze] elements
 *   - On DOM insertion, for dynamically added [save-freeze] elements
 *
 * At save time, the clone's innerHTML is replaced with the stored original.
 * Changes inside [save-freeze] elements do not trigger autosave dirty checks.
