/**
 * user-gesture — the "was a human driving this write?" signal for the
 * data-clobber guard. Small and dedicated (NOT behaviorCollector, which is the
 * analytics collector).
 *
 * How it works: capture-phase listeners for trusted user-intent events stamp
 * `lastTrustedGestureTs` (and set a same-turn `gestureTaskActive` flag, cleared
 * on the next macrotask). The Mutation hub calls `isUserDrivenNow()`
 * synchronously when it processes a DOM change. A change reads as user-driven if
 * it lands in the same turn as a gesture OR within `RECENT_GESTURE_MS` of the
 * last trusted gesture. The recency window is what attributes CROSS-TURN
 * first-party edits: a button's `click` handler runs a turn after its
 * `pointerdown`, and a confirm-modal delete runs a macrotask after the Confirm
 * gesture (theModal defers its resolve via setTimeout) — both mutate a few ms
 * after the gesture, inside the window. A background setTimeout / fetch().then()
 * mutation with no recent gesture reads background. Synthetic dispatchEvent /
 * el.click() are isTrusted=false, so a script can't fake a gesture.
 *
 * Why a bounded recency window and not `navigator.userActivation`: its transient
 * window is ~5s and consumable — too loose for a recovery tool, since a
 * background clobber within 5s of any click would read user-driven and suppress
 * the chip (silent data loss). `RECENT_GESTURE_MS` is an owned, tight window
 * stamped only by trusted gestures, so it's unspoofable and an order of
 * magnitude less exposed.
 *
 * The accumulated bit rides every save the page makes; the server splits a
 * UI-gestured save from a background-script save with it.
